## The project

## My role

My good friend Leo Brunnhofer started this project in 2014. After becoming self-employed in 2015, I joined him as <strong>Lead Software Developer</strong> and we developed the platform together. We launched the website as well as mobile apps for both Android and iOS in 2015 and run the project since then.
