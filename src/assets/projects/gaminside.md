## My role

### Software Developer, Lead Software Engineer & Technical Consultant

I joined the GAMInside team right after finishing university when it was still an early stage startup.

Over the years the team grew and I evolved into the role of Lead Software Engineer.

After leaving GAMInside to start my own self-employed business, I continued to provide technical consultancy.
